- **Frameworks and Libraries Used:**
  - Bootstrap framework for styling and layout
  - Fetch API for asynchronous operations

- **Development Process:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Created a part-4 branch from the part-3 branch.
     - Switched to the part-4 branch for development.

  2. **HTML Structure:**
     - Designed the HTML structure for the web application (index.html).
     - Ensured semantic HTML tags were used for better accessibility and SEO.

  3. **Styling with CSS:**
